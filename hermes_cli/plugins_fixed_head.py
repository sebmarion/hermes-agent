"""
Hermes Plugin System
====================

Discovers, loads, and manages plugins from four sources:

1. **Bundled plugins** – ``<repo>/plugins/<name>/`` (shipped with hermes-agent;
   ``memory/`` and ``context_engine/`` subdirs are excluded — they have their
   own discovery paths)
2. **User plugins**   – ``~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/``
3. **Project plugins** – ``./.hermes/plugins/<name>/`` (opt-in via
   ``HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS``)
4. **Pip plugins**     – packages that expose the ``hermes_agent.plugins``
   entry-point group.

Later sources override earlier ones on name collision, so a user or project
plugin with the same name as a bundled plugin replaces it.

Each directory plugin must contain a ``plugin.yaml`` manifest **and** an
``__init__.py`` with a ``register(ctx)`` function.

Lifecycle hooks
---------------
Plugins may register callbacks for any of the hooks in ``VALID_HOOKS``.
The agent core calls ``invoke_hook(name, **kwargs)`` at the appropriate
points.

Tool registration
-----------------
``PluginContext.register_tool()`` delegates to ``tools.registry.register()``
so plugin-defined tools appear alongside the built-in tools.
